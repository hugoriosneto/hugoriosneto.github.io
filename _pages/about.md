Welcome to my personal website! I'm Hugo Rios-Neto, a dedicated data scientist specializing in soccer analytics. I currently hold a critical role at 
Clube Atlético Mineiro where I leverage my skills to shape strategies based on data-driven insights.

My academic journey has taken me from a BSc in Computational Mathematics to an ongoing Masters in Computer Science, both at the prestigious 
Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. I've always had a deep-seated passion for soccer, and I've been fortunate enough to marry this love 
with my academic background to make a real impact on the game.

Born and raised in Brazil, I also spent some of my educational years in the United States, which has given me a broader perspective on 
the importance of good sports management. I'm a native Portuguese speaker and also very proficient in English.

Over the years, I've held pivotal roles, notably co-founding the Sports Analytics Lab (SALab) at UFMG, and working as a Data Scientist at Clube Atlético Mineiro. 
I've had the privilege of publishing two research papers, presenting my work at international conferences, and even organizing 
Football Analytics: Modeling and Experience 2022 (FAME '22) - the first-ever sports analytics event in Brazil.
