Welcome to my personal website! I'm Hugo Rios-Neto, a data science and machine learning researcher. I currently hold a data scientist role at 
<a href="https://atletico.com.br/">Clube Atlético Mineiro</a>.

My academic journey has taken me from a BSc in Computational Mathematics to an ongoing Masters in Computer Science, both at 
<a href="https://ufmg.br/">Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</a>. I've always had a passion for soccer, and I've been fortunate enough to marry this love 
with my academic background to try to make an impact on the game.

Born and raised in Brazil, I also spent a couple of years of my childhood and adolescence in the United States, which has given me a broader perspective on 
the importance of good sports management. I'm a native Portuguese speaker and also very proficient in English.

I pride myself in co-founding the <a href="https://salabufmg.github.io/">Sports Analytics Lab (SALab) at UFMG</a> in 2022, 
and working as a Data Scientist at Clube Atlético Mineiro from the start of the analytics department, the first of its type 
at a soccer club in Brazil. 

I've had the privilege of publishing two research papers, presenting my work at international conferences, and  
organizing "Football Analytics: Modeling and Experience 2022 (FAME '22)" - the first-ever sports analytics event in Brazil.
