I currently hold a Intelligence Engineer role at 
<a href="https://geminisports.co/">Gemini Sports Analytics</a>.

I did my Bachelor's in Computational Mathematics, and I'm now doing a Master's in Computer Science, both at 
<a href="https://ufmg.br/">Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais</a>.

I was the data scientist of <a href="https://x.com/Atletico">Atl√©tico Mineiro's</a> analytics department, 
the first analytics department of a Brazilian football club, having started when the department was created. 

I pride myself in co-founding the <a href="https://salabufmg.github.io/">Sports Analytics Lab (SALab) at UFMG</a> in 2022, 
the first sports analytics lab in Brazil.

I've also had the privilege of helping create and organize the first football analytics conference in Brazil, 
<a href="https://salabufmg.github.io/">Football Analytics: Modeling and Experience (FAME)</a>, which is going into its 3rd edition in 2024. 


In 2024, FAME will take part in one of the two days of the <a href="https://salabufmg.github.io/FOF24/">Future of Football</a> conference, 
organized in collaboration with 
<a href="https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/divisions-and-departments/preston-robert-tisch-institute-for-global-sport.html">NYU's Institute for Global Sport</a>.
